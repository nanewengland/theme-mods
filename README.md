# Theme Mods

Unfortunately Mesmerize Pro doesn't like child themes.

We have modified gravity pro forms to auto update meeting info fields for the meeting update forms.

`functions.php` if the theme is updated we must add the code from this file into the new `functions.php` as this file gets overwritten when theme gets updated.

`gfm.js` this must be added to theme folder as well when updated this is the mesmerize-pro theme folder, this contains the jquery stuff for forms.
